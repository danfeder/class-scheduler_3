## Notes
- Test utilities now provide foundation for comprehensive testing
- Builder pattern simplifies test data creation
- Need to focus on core algorithm testing next
- Grade progression is implemented as a soft preference
- Consecutive period constraints are working well but need real-world validation
- Need to gather data on typical grade progression patterns
- Consider making scoring weights configurable through UI
- UI improvements have significantly enhanced usability
- Type system improvements have reduced runtime errors
- Latest changes focus on improving scheduling completeness
- Current priority is fixing incomplete class scheduling issue
- Parallel processing improvements will follow once base scheduling works
