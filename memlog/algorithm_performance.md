### 2024-01-24: New Backtracking Implementation
#### Algorithm Components
- Multiple candidate solution tracking (max 3 solutions)
- Scoring system with weighted components:
  * Total length: -2x weight (minimize)
  * Grade group cohesion: 50x weight (primary)
  * Distribution quality: 30x weight
  * Grade progression: 10x weight (when enabled)
  * Constraint violations: -100x weight

#### Performance Characteristics
1. Time Complexity
   - O(n * p * d) per iteration where:
     * n = number of classes
     * p = periods per day (8)
     * d = maximum days to consider (42)
   - Limited to 1000 iterations maximum

2. Space Complexity
   - O(n * s) where:
     * n = number of classes
     * s = number of solutions maintained (3)

3. Optimization Strategies
   - Period prioritization based on grade group cohesion
   - Early pruning of unpromising solutions (score < 90% of best)
   - Smart backtracking with variation generation
   - Efficient grade progression scoring:
     * Only computed when enabled
     * Limited to inter-group transitions
     * Uses sorted date comparison

4. Constraint Optimizations
